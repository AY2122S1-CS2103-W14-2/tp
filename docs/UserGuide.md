## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [wa/WORK_ADDRESS]` can be used as `n/John Doe wa/Home` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the persons list for tracking.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL cn/CASE_NUMBER ha/HOME_ADDRESS [wa/WORK_ADDRESS] [qa/QUARANTINE_ADDRESS] [sh/SHN_PERIOD] [kn/NEXT_OF_KIN_NAME] [kp/NEXT_OF_KIN_PHONE] [ka/NEXT_OF_KIN_ADDRESS]`

### Editing a person : `edit`

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [cn/CASE_NUMBER] [ha/HOME_ADDRESS] [wa/WORK_ADDRESS] [qa/QUARANTINE_ADDRESS] [sh/SHN_PERIOD] [kn/NEXT_OF_KIN_NAME] [kp/NEXT_OF_KIN_PHONE] [ka/NEXT_OF_KIN_ADDRESS]`
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`
* The index **must be a positive integer** (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ..)
* The index **must not exceed the total number of persons** in the persons list
* There cannot be multiple persons with the same name (case-sensitive)
* At least one field to edit must be provided

Examples:
* `edit 1 n/Henry Hugh` edits the name of the first person in the list to be `Henry Hugh`

### Finding persons by a field: `find`

Finds person(s) based on the field specified by the user and displays them as a list with index numbers.

Format: `find FIELD_PREFIX KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`
* Field must be one of `n/`, `p/`, `cn/`, `sh/start:` or `sh/end:`
* For find by name (`n/`),
  * search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
  * full words will be matched e.g. Han will not match Hans
* For find by phone number (`p/`), phone numbers that starts with one or more keyword(s) will be matched e.g. `123` and `1234` will match `12345678`
* For find by case number (`cn/`),
  * search will only match if case number is equal to one or more keyword(s), e.g. `123` will match `123` but will not match `1234`
  * all keywords must be entered in valid case number formats
* For find by SHN start date (`sh/start:`),
  * search will only match if SHN start date is equal to one or more keyword(s), e.g. `2021-01-01` will match `2021-01-01`
  * all keywords must be entered in valid date formats
* For find by SHN end date (`sh/end:`), 
  * search will only match if SHN end date is equal to one or more keyword(s), e.g. `2021-01-02` will match `2021-01-02`
  * all keywords must be entered in valid date formats
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans` and `2021-01-01 2021-01-02 2021-01-03` will match `2021-01-01`
* Only one of the following can be searched at a time: name, phone, case number, SHN start date and SHN end date
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:
* `find n/John` will match the following names: `john` and `John Doe` 
* `find n/alex david` will match the following names: `Alex Yeoh` and `David Li` 
* `find p/123` will match the following phone numbers: `12345678` and `12387654` 
* `find cn/1` will match the following case numbers: `111` and `111` 
* `find sh/start:2021-01-01` will match the following SHN start dates: `2021-01-01` and `2021-01-02` 
* `find sh/end:2021-01-02` will match the following SHN end dates: `2021-01-01` and `2021-01-02` 

### Finding persons by name: `tshift`

Shifts all person's SHN end dates by the specified number of days.

Format: `tshift [PLUS_MINUS_SIGN]DAYS`
* `DAYS` should be a number between `1` and `90` inclusive
* Postpones the SHN end date if the evaluated value is positive
* Brings forward the SHN end date if the value is negative
* The SHN end dates will only be brought forward up to and including a day after the person's SHN start date

Examples:
* `tshift 3` postpones all SHN end dates by 3 days. This is identical to `tshift +3`
* `tshift -3` brings forward all SHN end dates by up to 3 days

### Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the person(s) identified by the specified index number(s) used in the displayed persons list.

Format: `delete INDEX [MORE_INDICES]`

* Deletes the contact(s) at the specified `INDEX`(s).
* The index(s) **must be a positive integer** (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ..)
* The index(s) **must not exceed the total number of contacts** in the address book
* The index(s) **can be given in any order** (e.g. `delete 1 4 5`, `delete 5 1 4`)

Examples:
* `sort n/` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the contacts list when sorted by name. 
* `sort cn/` followed by `delete 1 4 5` deletes the 1st, 4th and 5th persons in the contacts list when sorted by case
  number.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command, if any.

### Listing all persons : `list`

Format: `list`

### Sorting all persons : `sort`

Sorts the contacts list based on the specified field prefixes.

Format: `sort [n/DIRECTION] [cn/DIRECTION] [sh/start:DIRECTION] [sh/end:DIRECTION]`

* Sorts the contacts list from the first to the last specified field prefix.
* At least one field prefix must be specified.
* Direction "asc" indicates ascending order and "dsc" indicates descending order.
* Specifying the sort direction is optional. By default, field prefixes are sorted in ascending order.

Examples:
* `sort n/` sorts the contacts list by name (in ascending order by default).
* `sort sh/end:dsc` sorts the contacts list by end date of SHN period in descending order.
* `sort sh/start: cn/asc` sorts the contacts list by start date of SHN period (in ascending order by default), then by case number in ascending order.

### Clearing all persons : `clear`
