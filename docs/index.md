* Track2Gather is an app that will manage up to a few thousand contacts, providing basic features for contact tracing
  personnel to organise and search through them via:
    * personal information (limited to English names and Singaporean contact numbers and addresses)
    * case contacts
    * quarantine period

* If you are interested in using Track2Gather, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Track2Gather, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
