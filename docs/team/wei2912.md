### Project: Track2Gather

Track2Gather is a desktop application that will manage up to a few thousand contacts, providing basic features for
contact tracing personnel to organise and search through them via personal information, case contacts and quarantine
period. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has
about 10 kLoC.
